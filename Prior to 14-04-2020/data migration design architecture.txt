Data migration

1: Understand the data
	-data standards
	-data health
	-how will the data be used tomorrow 
	- what is missing
	-de-duplicate
	-transform
	
	Validation:
		-relevance
		-accuracy
		-integrity
		-consistency
		-validity
		-accesibility
		
	why validations:
		-improved corporate performance
		-increased compettitive advantage
		-reduced uncerteainity & risk
		-reduced delays & waiting time
		-measurable & accute view of data
		-better accountability

2: Extraction of data
	-move data from a db to excel 									|
													|
3: transformation											|		
	-match the data to its new forms; and ensure that metadata reflects the data in each fields	|
													|
4: Cleansing												|
	-de-duplicate;											|
	-run tests											|
	-address any corrupted data(we can use maching learning(cognitive bots) here)			|	RECOVERY Options at every stage of the migration
													|
5: validation												|
	-test and re-test that moving data to the target location provides the expected response	|	data security as well
													|
6: Loading the data into the new system									|
	-transfer the data into the new system and review for errors again				|
	-transfer of the data will be happeneing on weekends and bank holidays				|

		stage 1:move student address information after validation and look zip code



stage 2: move academic info as-is



stage 3: identify missing info and aggregate those info external sources 



stage 4: identify redundant or info that can be derived and then remove them before ingestion



phase 1: extract the data from a excel


phase 2: extract data from multiple dbs


phase 3: iq bot(cognitive ablities for enriching data)

	**=>why are you creating it?**
	**=>for whom you are creating it?**

#go to the detailed level.

	
	#move the data from excel to to registration application#
		3 ways: -db query
			-db browser
